This package adds the proceduralimage directive to Sphinx_.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

It allows a python code snippet to be supplied, that generates an image, that
will be included in the documentation.

It adds a single directive, `proceduralimage`. It takes a block of python
code, executes the code and extracts the local variables `image_data` and
`alt`. image_data will be saved to a .png in _images and embedded and
the alt variable will be used as the images alt tag.

The code is based almost entirely on sphinx.ext.graphviz.
